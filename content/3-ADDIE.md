## Analysis

The instructional designers are typically presented with a problem that may come from different places - the client, data, new software, etc. It is necessary to conduct a performance analysis first to find out what the problem really is, the cause of the problem, and what interventions (solutions) we can use to solve the problem. If the gap caused by training and not by other factors (social and emotional reasons, attitude, environment, etc.), then we proceed with an instructional design approach to solve the problem.

In addition to performance analysis, <a href="https://www.devlinpeck.com/posts/analysis-instructional-design" target="_blank">other types of analysis</a> include:
- Learner Analysis - What are the characteristics of the learners?
- Context analysis – In what kind of conditions will the learners be trained and acquire their new skills?
- Gap analysis – what is the current and the desired state?
- Task analysis – What knowledge and skills will the learners acquire?

## Design

#### Learning Taxonomies, Learning Objectives and Assessment 

#### Instructional Strategies 

## Development

#### Multimedia principles

#### Common Software

## Implementation

During this stage, the materials created during development are introduced to the target audience and the learning process starts. Depending on the chosen format, the <a href="https://elearningindustry.com/getting-know-addie-implementation" target="_blank">implementation stage</a> will likely include the following main steps to a greater or lesser degree:

1. Training the instructors
2. Preparing the learners
3. Preparing the environment
