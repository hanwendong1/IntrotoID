## Analysis

The instructional designers are typically presented with a problem that may come from different places - the client, data, new software, etc. It is necessary to conduct a performance analysis first to find out what the problem really is, the cause of the problem, and what interventions (solutions) we can use to solve the problem. If the gap caused by training and not by other factors (social and emotional reasons, attitude, environment, etc.), then we proceed with an instructional design approach to solve the problem.

In addition to performance analysis, <a href="https://www.devlinpeck.com/posts/analysis-instructional-design" target="_blank">other types of analysis</a> include:
- Learner Analysis - What are the characteristics of the learners?
- Context analysis – In what kind of conditions will the learners be trained and acquire their new skills?
- Gap analysis – what is the current and the desired state?
- Task analysis – What knowledge and skills will the learners acquire?

## Design

After completing task analysis, instructional designers can begin writing learning objectives. To demonstrate that students have achieved the desired outcome, a <a href="https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/taxonomies-learning" target="_blank">taxonomy of learning</a> can be useful for defining the types of work that we want our students to do. Popular taxonomies include <a href="https://tips.uark.edu/using-blooms-taxonomy/" target="_blank">Bloom’s taxonomy</a> and David Merrill's <a href="https://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/component-display/" target="_blank">Component Display Theory</a>.

One method that can be useful when writing a learning objective or outcome is the  <a href="https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/m1uotc/CP71152673350001451" target="_blank">A. B. C. D. method</a>:
1.	Audience: Who are your learners (who will be doing the performance)?
2.	Behavior: Describe the task or behavior using action verbs -- be sure it is something that can be heard or something that is observable.
3.	Conditions: Under what conditions (what tools, aids or reference materials can the learner use? Are there things that they won't be able to use?)
4.	Degree: To what degree of mastery -- how well must it be done (speed, accuracy, quality, etc.)?

#### Instructional Strategies 

## Development

#### Multimedia principles

#### Common Software

## Implementation

During this stage, the materials created during development are introduced to the target audience and the learning process starts. Depending on the chosen format, the <a href="https://elearningindustry.com/getting-know-addie-implementation" target="_blank">implementation stage</a> will likely include the following main steps to a greater or lesser degree:

1. Training the instructors
2. Preparing the learners
3. Preparing the environment
