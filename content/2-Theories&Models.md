## Learning Theories
<a href="https://www.instructionaldesigncentral.com/learning-theory/" target="_blank">Learning theories</a> are abstract frameworks that describe how knowledge is received and processed during the learning experience. Learning theory informs the application of instructional design through models.

## ADDIE

The <a href="https://www.instructionaldesigncentral.com/addie-model" target="_blank">ADDIE instructional design model</a> is the generic process traditionally used by instructional designers and training developers to create learning content and experiences. Most of the current instructional design models are spin-offs or variations of the ADDIE instructional design model.

## Instructional Design Models
 
<a href="https://www.instructionaldesigncentral.com/instructionaldesignmodels" target="_blank">Instructional design models</a> help instructional designers to make sense of abstract learning theory and enable real world application. Instructional design models organize and visualize learning theories and principles to guide instructional designers through a learning development process.
 
All instructional design models are some variations of ADDIE. Some well-known instructional design models include <a href="https://educationaltechnology.net/dick-and-carey-instructional-model/" target="_blank">Dick and Carey Model</a>, <a href="https://educationaltechnology.net/kemp-design-model/" target="_blank">Morrison, Ross, Kemp Model</a>, <a href="https://educationaltechnology.net/assure-instructional-design-model/" target="_blank">ASSURE Model</a>, and <a href="https://community.articulate.com/articles/an-introduction-to-sam-for-instructional-designers" target="_blank">SAM Model</a>.
