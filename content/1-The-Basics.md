According to <a href="https://onlinelearningconsortium.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Instructional-Design-in-Higher-Education-Report.pdf" target="_blank"> Instructional Design in Higher Education</a>, Most instructional designers have four categories of responsibilities:
1. Design instructional materials and courses, particularly for digital delivery 
2. Manage the efforts of faculty, administration, IT, other instructional designers, and others to achieve better student learning 
3. Train faculty to leverage technology and implement pedagogy effectively
